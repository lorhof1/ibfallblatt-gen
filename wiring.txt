female conn w/ notch to the right layout:
C_
cg
xg
dd
dd
_d
__
s_

legend: C = inverse clock, c = clock, x = extra, d = data, g = ground, _ = unknown (some sort of feedback), s = not connected, can be repurposed, e.g. as a power rail for the esp32
logic voltage is 5V, but 3.3V is enough

same layout, esp32 connection scheme (connect d's to 15-19, leave _'s unconnected):
VIN only works if the corresponding pin is wired to the 5V regulator output on the adjacent module control board
